The best way to avoid this problem is to infer the model schema based on a realistic data sample (training dataset) that includes missing values. Alternatively, you can declare integer columns as doubles (float64) whenever these columns may have missing values. See `Handling Integers With Missing Values <https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#handling-integers-with-missing-values>`_ for more details.\n","  warnings.warn(\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","================================================================================\n","GLOBAL BEST MODEL\n","================================================================================\n","Best key: standard_xgboost\n","Best Test F1(macro): 1.0\n","✓ Saved best model to: /content/drive/MyDrive/work/Finalproject/housing_app_fall25-main/models/best_classification_model.joblib\n","\n","Classification Report (decoded):\n","              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","        fail       0.43      1.00      0.60      1081\n","        pass       1.00      0.50      0.67      2919\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.64      4000\n","   macro avg       0.71      0.75      0.63      4000\n","weighted avg       0.84      0.64      0.65      4000\n","\n","\n","Elapsed time: 1.22 minutes\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Successfully registered model 'minmax_xgboost_pipeline'.\n","Created version '1' of model 'minmax_xgboost_pipeline'.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"xleo4poSgWj2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
